USE
---------------
Run on an emulator and you can Create Read Update Delete(CRUD) notes.
You can switch between English and Greek languages from the menu(you can do the same for other languages too).
This app is responsive to all devices that's why no extra layout folders needed.

There is also unit testing (NoteAdapterTest) in the project where you can make tests using fake data.

API
---------------
The current API is mock where you can't make changes.
You can replace the url of the API with yours so you can freely use CRUD.
